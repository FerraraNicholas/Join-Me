# Join-Me
A web application developed in NodeJS and used in conjunction with MySQL relational database management system. This lightweight app accepts an Email and inserts it into a MySQL database which is then queried to send notifications when a new project of mine has been posted as well as update the amount of users on the homepage. Highlights include https calls such as GET and POST, Express MVC framework as well as SQL queries.
